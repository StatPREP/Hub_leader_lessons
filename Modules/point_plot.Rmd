# Data and Point Plots

```{r include = FALSE}
SDSdata::sds_setup()
library(DT)
```

Data can be many things, but one of the most common formats is a data frame, a kind of spreadsheet of rows and columns. We'll work with the data frame `Births_2014`, which is based on data  published by the US Centers for Disease Control. `Births_2014` has 100,000 rows. Each row reports a birth in the US in 2014. There are dozens of variables, a few of which are shown below.

```{r echo = FALSE}
sds_table(sample_n(Births_2014, size = 10) %>%
               select(sex, baby_wt, gestation, delivery, age_mother, wic), nrows = 100000)
```
