# Lessons for Stat 101

*Stat 101* is one name for the conventional introductory statistics course. This site contains lessons for teaching topics generally found in Stat 101, but rooting them in real data. 

These *Lessons for Stat 101* generally involve computing which is provided entirely through mouse-driven, web-based "Little Apps". Using these Little Apps requires an ordinary web browser and nothing more.

The lessons here cover these topics:

#. the normal distribution
#. center and spread
#. the t-test
#. linear regression

Each of the lessons contains a number of components:

1. Instructor facing
    - A brief orientation to the statistical method.
    - A description of how the method fits in with statistical practice.
    - The conceptual pitfalls faced by students and instructors and common misconceptions frequently encounted among statistics instructors.
    - A detailed statement of learning objectives written with an eye to assessment of whether those objectives have been met.
    - The background needed by students to undertake each lesson.
    - Tips on using the lesson to create an active classroom.
    - Items that can be used for assessment.
    - A "pushing the envelope" section to help instructors who want deeper insight into the statistical methods, including a description in which the traditional topics have become obsolete or no longer reflect good statistical practice.
    

2. Student facing
    - Individual lesson documents illuminating varied aspects of or approaches to the topic. Many of these are best used as in-class, small-group activities, but they can also be used  the basis for class lectures. The documents can be customized, extended, or simplified by the instructor.
    - The Little Apps around which most of the lessons have been written, but which are flexible enough to support free exploration of statistical topics either led by the instructor or self-guided by the student.


The Little Apps can be used with or without the lessons. The Apps are designed to use data to present broad statistical concepts, including descriptive statistics, modeling, statistical inference, and hypothesis tests. The interactive format allows students to explore many data sets and many variables within each data set. The data have been selected from published sources and provide many real settings for informative statistical investigation. The Apps allow students to work with multiple variables and generally provide facilities for working with covariates.
